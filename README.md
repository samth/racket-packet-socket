# Access to raw Ethernet frames from Racket

If Racket needs a packet from a socket or a port,  
you might just find it's nowhere near as easy as you thought.  
Up in complicated ioctls you'll be caught,  
Ensuring error-freedom is particularly fraught!

Dashing to the rescue is this polished little package:  
A tiny C extension, with a pinch of Racket hackage,  
Relieves you of your burden and returns you to your slackage,  
And competently fixes Racket's packet socket lackage.

## What?

Read and write raw Ethernet frames from Racket programs. 

## How?

```racket
(require packet-socket)

(display (raw-interface-names))
(newline)

(define handle (raw-interface-open "eth0:1"))
(unless handle (error 'example "Couldn't open the device"))

(define packet (raw-interface-read handle)) ;; blocks

(raw-interface-write handle packet)

(raw-interface-close handle)
```

You will need to take care of Ethernet frame headers, footers,
checksums and addressing yourself. You may find the Racket package
[bitsyntax](https://github.com/tonyg/racket-bitsyntax) useful to you
in manipulating binary data structures.
